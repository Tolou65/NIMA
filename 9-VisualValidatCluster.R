VisualClusterInBipartite <- function(x, y=NULL, verbose=FALSE) {
  # Plot the bipartite graph with color coding for different cluster in different projections.
  #
  # Args:
  #   x: adjacency matrix of the bipartite graph.
  #   y: User given feature vector for clustering of each projection, default is NULL which means that this vector is calculated internally.
  #   verbose: a binary value indicating whether the plot should be save as .png file or not. Default is False.
  #
  # Returns:
  #   the plot of bipartite graph with color coding for different clusters.
