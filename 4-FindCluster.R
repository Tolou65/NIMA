  # Find the clusters in one projection of the bipartite graph of the given adjacent matrix.
  #
  # Args:
  #   x: incidance matrixn of the graph.
  #   dim: integer value choose which projection should be use. Default is 1 which use the projection to the first set. other option: 2.
  #   plot: binary value indicates that the result should be plotted or not. default is False.
  #   verbose: If TRUE, the plot is saved as the .png file in the working directory. Default is FALSE.

  # Returns:
  #   the clusters and the nodes in each as an object. (This object can have the number of the cluster and the number of nodes in each cluster additional to the clusters)
