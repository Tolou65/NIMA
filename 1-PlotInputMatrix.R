PlotInput <- function(x, index_nominal, index_numeric, color= NULL, verbose = FALSE) {
  # Plot the given matrix with heatmap plot.
  #
  # Args:
  #   x: Data Frame containing the missing values. 3 columns (at least 2 nominal columns)
  #   index_nominal: a vector with two values. the indexes for the nominal columns (the first value indicating the rows objects and the second value indicating the column object)
  #   index_numeric: index for numeric values. (this is value for selecting the column which contains our numeric values and we change it to
  #   the matrix for missing value investigation and imputation) 
  #   color: color plate use for the heatmap, default is NULL. (Find the option for the future used function later and include it as options).
  #   verbose: If TRUE, the plot is saved as the .png file in the working directory. Default is FALSE.
  #
  # Returns:
  #   Plot the heatmap of the input matrix.
  
  
  # show the axis values by appropriate rate.
  return()
