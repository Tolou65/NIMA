PlotBipartite <- function(x, dim= 0, verbose = FALSE) {
  # Plot the given adjacent matrix of the bipartite graph.
  #
  # Args:
  #   x: incidence matrix the graph.
  #   dim: integer value choose between plotting the original biparitite graph or its projection. Default is 0 which prot the original bipartite graph. other options: 1, 2
  #   verbose: If TRUE, the plot is saved as the .png file in the working directory. Default is FALSE.
  #
  # Returns:
  #   Plot the bipartite graph of the input matrix.
